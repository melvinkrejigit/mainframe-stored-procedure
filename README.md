# Mainframe Stored Procedure Deployment

Initial repository setup for local development.

## Current test query

`current-timestamp.sql` runs a DB2 query that returns the current timestamp:

```sql
SELECT CURRENT TIMESTAMP
FROM SYSIBM.SYSDUMMY1;
```

Stored procedure source, JCL, Zowe integration, and Azure DevOps pipeline configuration will be added in later steps.
